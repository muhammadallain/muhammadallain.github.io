  <h5>Embedded System Engineer - R&D</h5> <h6>Four Corners Technologies (4CT) Pvt. Ltd, India.</span><span class="float-right text-muted">Oct 2016 - Nov 2018 (2.1 years)</span></h6>
  </div>
At 4CT, we developed end-to-end IoT smart solutions for retails, workspace, kiosks, and outdoor billboards. I was the hardware guy in this firm, where my role was to design-build-program the wireless embedded system of IoT devices, then connect its data stream to cloud services hosting our in-house analytics engines. Below is the list of projects that I contributed to, which are currently deployed on a large scale and one of the high revenue sources for the firm. <ul class="event-list">

<li>Workspace Occupancy Monitoring: We designed a wireless embedded system with Panasonic Grid Eye thermal sensor to monitor the workspace occupancy. This occupancy data was sent to our web app to generate client requirement-based meaningful insights such as rich visualization of building and workspace utilization, detailed occupancy patterns, extensive reporting of occupancy by the department and by function, etc.</li>

<li>Remote Hoardings Monitoring: We designed an IP66 grade Linux-based IoT camera with 4G connectivity and integrated multiple outdoor LDR sensors. 250 of our IoT cameras were installed across the city and rural areas to monitor the outdoor billboards to provide view clarity, material quality, installation quality, pillar quality, lighting quality, live stream, etc. when requested by the billboard owners or clients via our billboard management system.</li>

<li>Retail Sense 'Progressive business decisions with live data at your Fingertips'. We designed Retail Sense, which is a low-cost camera-based wireless footfall people counter. The raw footfall count was sent to our web app, where it was converted into meaningful information that revealed patterns and profitable insight which is used to make key decisions on ideal staffing levels with placement based on the hour, day, month, season, facilityâ€™s layout and operations, etc.</li>

<li>e-Health Kiosks: We designed an MCU-based embedded system using sensors to accurately measure the height (using MaxBotix ultrasonic sensor), weight (using load cells mapped to a 24 bit ADC), and heart rate (using Max30100 pulse oximetry sensor). This board computes the height (cms) weight (Kgs) and heart rate (BPM & SPO2) and sends it to the system of the digital signage kiosk via USB.</li>

					<p>When the environment is not optimal, the efficacy of vaccines is lost, especially when health workers carry vaccines in a portable box during door-to-door polio campaigns. The designed 'Smart Portable IoT Vaccine Monitor' continuously monitors the vaccines using multiple sensors and runs local analytics to ensure vaccine efficacy is preserved. The timely alerts from our device prevent administering less potent vaccines during campaigns. This proposed concept and prototype won second place at Mouser IoT Design Contest, National level, India <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/iot-vaccine-monitor-bharath-s" target="_blank" class="link">[Link]</a>.</p>
